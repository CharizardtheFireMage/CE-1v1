If you are not familiar with what is Catch and Evolve in general, do not worry! Catch and Evolve is a tier at which the user is given a LC starter by the C&E Host, and he/she has to use it during the tournament. If he wins a battle against an opponent, he has the option of "stealing" the opponent's pokemon and evolving one of the pokemon he/she has in his/her team. This will continue until the user had won the tournament. Always remember that Focus Sash is banned in the first round. 

# Example of Playing C&E

Person A: Starter?
Person B (Host): Litten.

 • Person A makes a team with just Litten (you can create any set for your starter).
 
 • Person A faces Person C, who has a Rowlet.
 
 • Person A wins against Person C, and takes his Rowlet and adds it to his team.
 
 • Person A has the decision of evolving either his Litten or Rowlet.
 
 • Person A decides to evolve Litten into Torracat.
 
 This continues on, until Person A wins the tournament, or loses against someone.
 
# What is C&E 1v1 and the rules to this event?

Basically C&E 1v1 is an event at which rather than using the model of C&E (6v6), it has been manipulated to work with the 1v1 tier. The difference between C&E (in general) and C&E 1v1 is that you are restricted to using one pokemon during the battle in the C&E 1v1 event (rather than the standard 1-6 pokemon). Even though C&E allows Focus Sash R1, C&E 1v1 bans the use of having the item. 

Rules of C&E 1v1:
-----------------
1. Scouting is prohibited and will not be tolerated. Even though scouting will be turned off during the tournament, people might leak sets or pokemon that an user is having/using. If any user is caught leaking anything about their opponent (if they lost), they will be muted or banned from tournaments for a while as a punishment. 
2. Bringing a standard 1v1 team during the tournament rather than the designated C&E 1v1 team will lead to a disqualification.
3. When asking for your starter, please be patient as the C&E host has to give a starter for everyone that joins the tournament, not just you. If you are being unpatient and constantly ask for your starter, we have the right of giving you the starter last. 
4. If you are not satisfied with the starter pokemon that you got from the host, you have the right to reroll for another starter. Please note, this is your final decision and you are forced to start the tournament with the rerolled pokemon. 
5. You have the choice of replacing pokemon if you win a C&E 1v1 tournament battle as your team is restricted to 3 pokemon. Please remember that this is your final decision, and you can't use the replaced pokemon ever again as this tournament continues.
