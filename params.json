  "tagline": "Grats on driver. You are now officially room staff of Other Metas. There are a few more rules that you need to know, but are still expected to follow ALL voice rules. (If you need to review just do /staffintro).",
  "body": "\r\n \r\n### General things you need to know:\r\n1. You are now room staff. This means you represent Other Metas throughout the entire server. If we find out you have a bad reputation around the server and are making us look like we have bad auth, we will not think twice before demoting you. Also, do NOT advertise in other official rooms. It was ok if you were a reg and didn't know the rules, oh well. But now, you represent us and if you advertise in another official room, it brings shame.\r\n2. You should know the majority if not all of the tiers on the poll and how they are played. If someone came in and asked: What is 2v2? You should be able to give them a adequate response. If not, you can always do !om tier.\r\n3. We do not have a staff room, but we have a staff group chat on skype. You are expected to be able to join us, as many important conversations come up from time to time, where we need all staff input.\r\n4. You may nominate for driver or voice either by PMing a room senior staff (&/#) or by posting in chat. We will hold a vote from there.\r\n5. Do NOT tell the person you nominated that you nominated them. That is considered leaking and will be punished.\r\n6. Driver require a bit of work to earn, because you have to prove we can trust you as a voice and you are willing to work hard enough. However, this position, like all the rest, is fairly easy to lose. We are looking for 30+ logged actions per month. (You can check by using /modlog username). This sounds like a lot, but it is definitely not. When you start and end polls, it already registers as an action, along with DQing people, starting tours, setting autodq, and setting autostart. We periodically assess our staff and promote and demote.\r\n \r\n### How to moderate:\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with the commands, the three you need to know are:\r\n- /warn user,reason for warn\r\n- /mute user,reason for mute\r\n- /hm user, reason for mute\r\n(**Note: Reason is unnecessary if you don't want to or if it's obvious like spam.**)\r\n- /warn will give the user a pop-up for 5 seconds. Use this when they post something inappropriate or advertise for another room, etc.\r\n- /mute will mute the user for 7 mins. Use this when they have been warned already, or in more extreme cases, post something flat out wrong.\r\n- /hm will mute the user for 60 mins. Use this when they have been warned multiple times, possibly muted, and continue to defy orders. You can also jump straight to this if they spam.\r\n\r\nThe most important part I stress about this is: Use your judgement!! You don't always have to follow these rules. Just do what you think is right.\r\n \r\nI know this was probably painful and boring to read through, but now you are much better off than those who just decided not to read this. Thank you for your time, and keep working hard!",
